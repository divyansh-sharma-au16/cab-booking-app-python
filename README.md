 Cab Booking Problem :
### Problem Statement:
We want to build a cab booking platform to allow a rider to book a cab.

### Details:
* The location is represented as a (x, y) coordinate.
* Distance between two points (x1, y1) and(x2, y2) is sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)
* Platform has decided upon the maximum distance a driver has to travel to pickup a rider.
* A cab has only 1 driver.
* Sharing of cab is not allowed between riders
* There is a single type of cab

Please build an application that exposes following features to riders and drivers.
* Register a rider.
* Register a driver/cab
* Update a cab's location
* A driver can switch on/off his availability
* A rider can book a cab
* Fetch history of all rides taken by a rider.
* End the Trip


### Expectation from this round
* Code should be extensible.
* Clean professional level code.
* Functional Completeness including good modelling.
* User Identification.


 Brief : In this project I have tried to make ONE Command Line Interface User interactive program wherein all the above mentioned functionalities are taken care of.
secondly I have also craeted one GUI program for the same which gives us an sample idea how this might look like in form of a real life website or an application.


 Technologies :
   - Project is created with:
      * Python: 3.9.1 - this project has entirely been prepared on python and its various modules and functionalities.
      * For the small GUI presentation of the same I have used Pygame version 2.0.1
    
 Setup :
To run this project:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install Python
3. RUN $cabbooking.py
4. for running Cabbie(GUI) install pygame version 2.0.1
